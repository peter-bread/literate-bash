# Literate Bash

Very basic literate programming for Bash and Markdown.

Files ending in `.lsh.md` are interpreted as literate Markdwon files.

All code must be in codeblocks starting with <code>```bash</code>.

Example:

````md
This is a regular Markdown file.

Below is some bash:

```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```
````
